## Application Questions & Answers

### Q1: Do you have experience with React and Next.js? If yes, please describe a project where you used them.

Yes, 3+ years building production SaaS apps. Built **FinderLaunch** (product launch platform) using Next.js 14 App Router with React Server Components, tRPC for type-safe APIs, and shadcn/ui. Features include admin dashboard with real-time analytics (Recharts), feature flags system, user management with role-based access control, and BullMQ job queues. Also built **SemanticPen** (10k+ users) - AI content platform with RAG system using vector embeddings, streaming LLM responses, and complex state management. Optimized bundle sizes, implemented skeleton loading states, and achieved <200ms API response times.

### Q2: Do you have experience with Prisma ORM & PostgreSQL? If yes, please describe your experience and how you've used it in past projects.

I use **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL (similar to Prisma but more lightweight). Built 5+ production apps with PostgreSQL including:
- Type-safe schema definitions with Drizzle
- Complex queries with joins, aggregations, and transactions
- Database migrations with drizzle-kit
- Vector search with pgvector extension for RAG system
- Indexed fields for performance optimization
- Soft deletes and audit logging
- Deployed on Supabase, Neon, and Railway

Experience includes user management, subscriptions, payment integration, and real-time data sync. Comfortable with Prisma's API and can transition quickly.

### Q3: Do you use AI? What's your AI coding setup?

Yes, heavily integrated into workflow:
- **Claude Code (Anthropic)** for architecture decisions, debugging, and code generation
- **GitHub Copilot** for autocomplete and boilerplate
- **Custom AI tooling**: Built SemanticPen with OpenAI, OpenRouter, Google Gemini integration - understand LLM APIs, prompt engineering, and streaming responses
- Use AI for: refactoring, writing tests, documentation, troubleshooting complex bugs
- Always review and test AI-generated code - treat it as a senior pair programmer, not autopilot

### Q4: Do you have experience with other Programming languages?

Yes, beyond JavaScript/TypeScript:
- **Python**: Used for AI/ML scripts, data processing, sentence transformers for embeddings
- **SQL**: Advanced PostgreSQL queries, stored procedures, pgvector functions
- **Bash**: Shell scripting for deployment automation, Docker setups
- **Node.js**: Backend APIs, job queues (BullMQ), worker processes
- Primarily full-stack TypeScript/JavaScript for web development
